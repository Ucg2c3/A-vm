# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

    # Path to the artifact serving as the subject of the attestation. Must
    # specify exactly one of "subject-path", "subject-digest", or

    # (total subject count cannot exceed 1024).
    subject-path:

    # SHA256 digest of the subject for the attestation. Must be in the form
    # "sha256:hex_digest" (e.g. "sha256:abc123..."). Must specify exactly one

    # Subject name as it should appear in the attestation. Required when
    # identifying the subject with the "subject-digest" input.

    # Path to checksums file containing digest and name of subjects for
    # attestation. Must specify exactly one of "subject-path", "subject-digest",

    # Whether to push the attestation to the image registry. Requires that the
    # "subject-name" parameter specify the fully-qualified image name and that
